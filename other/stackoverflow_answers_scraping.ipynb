      "Line1: I represent a group of academics that are trying to predict stocks in a general form that can also be applied to anything, even the rating of content. Our algorithm, which we describe as truth seeking, works as follows. Basically each participant has their own credence rating. This means that the higher your credence or credibility, then the more their vote counts. Credence is worked out by how close to the weighted credence each vote is. It's like you get a better credence value the closer you get to the average vote that has already been adjusted for credence. For example, let's say that everyone is predicting that a stock's value will be at value X in 30 day's time (a future's option). People who predict on the average get a better credence. The key here is that the individual doesn't know what the average is, only the system. The system is tweaked further by weighting the guesses so that the target spot that generates the best credence is those votes that are already endowed with more credence. So the smartest people (historically accurate) project the sweet spot that will be used for further defining who gets more credence. The system can be improved too to adjust over time. For example, when you find out the actual value, those people who guessed it can be rewarded with a higher credence. In cases where you can't know the future outcome, you can still account if the average weighted credence changes in the future. People can be rewarded even more if they spotted the trend early. The point is we don't need to even know the outcome in the future, just the fact that the weighted rating changed in the future is enough to reward people who betted early on the sweet spot. Such a system can be used to rate anything from stock prices, currency exchange rates or even content itself. One such implementation asks people to vote with two parameters. One is their actual vote and the other is an assurity percentage, which basically means how much a particular participant is assured or confident of their vote. In this way, a person with a high credence does not need to risk downgrading their credence when they are not sure of their bet, but at the same time, the bet can be incorporated, it just won't sway the sweet spot as much if a low assurity is used. In the same vein, if the guess is directly on the sweet spot, with a low assurity, they won't gain the benefits as they would have if they had used a high assurity.\n",
      "Line2: have a look at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php and see if you find some topic that you like. If you have experience with C++ and C it will be easier learning Matlab. Regarding your topic to use, i suggest you see the link above, and try to find something that you like that can be applied to NN, search acm, ieee or other repositories for papers about NN and see if you can find also studies or reports about the topic you may be looking for. Good luck.\n",
      "Line3: Many great answers posted already, but I wanted to add my 2 cents.There is one hot topic in which big companies all around are investing lots of resources into, and is still a very challenging topic with lots of potential: Automated detection of fake news. This is even more relevant nowadays where most of us are connecting though social media and there's a huge crisis looming over. Fake news, content removal, source reliability... The problem is huge and very exciting. It is as I said challenging as it can be seen from many perspectives (from analising images to detect fakes using adversarial netwotks to detecting fake written news based on text content (NLP) or using graph theory to find sources) and the possbilities for a research proyect are endless. I suggest you read some general articles (e.g this or this ) or have a look at research articles from the last couple of years (a quick google seach will throw you a lot of related stuff). I wish I had the opportunity of starting over a project based on this topic. I think it's going to be of the upmost relevance in the next few years.\n",
      "Line4: Two ideas: Write a current, robust version of SHRDLU with understandable source code. Write a SHRDLU-like program that manipulates actual code instead of imaginary blocks.  Such a tool could be used for manipulating extremely large, complicated programs, including its own code! Imagine giving commands like the following... (a) Scan web site X and list any sentences you failed to parse. (b) Scan document Y and list any grammar rules you didn't need. (c) Instead of iterating over every element of \"proplist\" in your \"search\" function, only process the cdr of \"proplist\" if the initial call to \"lookup\" returns nil.  After you make the modification, confirm the sentence \"pick up a very very big block\" will succeed and the sentence \"pick up a very and very big block\" will fail. (d) Your \"conjoin\" grammar currently requires a coordinator word like \"and\", but that requirement is wrong.  Split your \"coordination\" grammar into \"syndetic coordination\" and \"asyndetic coordination\" as follows:  conjoins using \"and\", as in \"quickly and quietly, he walked into the bank\" are called \"syndetic coordinations\".  Conjoins without a coordinator, as in \"quickly, quietly, he walked into the bank\" are \"asyndetic coordinations\".  Now scan corpus Z to see if fewer sentences fail to parse.\n",
